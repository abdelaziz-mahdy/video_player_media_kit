### Linux

System shared libraries from distribution specific user-installed packages are used by-default. You can install these as follows.

        ^
/path/to/media_kit/media_kit_test/build/macos/Build/Products/Debug/media_kit_video/media_kit_video.framework/Headers/media_kit_video-Swift.h:270:31: warning: 'objc_ownership' only applies to Objective-C object or block pointer types; type here is 'CVPixelBufferRef' (aka 'struct __CVBuffer *')

#define POD_CONFIGURATION_DEBUG 1 DEBUG=1
        ^

        ^
```

### iOS (replace original video_player with media_kit one)

1. The minimum supported iOS version is 13.0,set IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 13.0 in `ios\Runner.xcodeproj\project.pbxproj`
2. Just add this package in case you set iosUseMediaKit to true in initVideoPlayerMediaKitIfNeeded

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  media_kit_libs_ios_video: ^1.1.1                # iOS package for video native libraries.
```

### Android (replace original video_player with media_kit one)

1. Just add this package in case you set androidUseMediaKit to true in initVideoPlayerMediaKitIfNeeded

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  media_kit_libs_android_video: ^1.3.0           # Android package for video native libraries.
```

1. Add the Video Player Media Kit dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```
dependencies:
  video_player_media_kit: ^0.0.20
```

3.  Import the package in your Dart code

```
import 'package:video_player_dart_vlc/video_player_media_kit.dart';
```

4.  Initialize the Video Player Media Kit interface in the main function of your app

```
void main() {
  initVideoPlayerMediaKitIfNeeded(); //parameter iosUseMediaKit can be used to make ios use media_kit instead of video_player
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

now video_player will work on any platform.
